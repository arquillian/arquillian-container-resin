   ARQUILLIAN + RESIN 4
   ======================


This is the Arquillian Plugin for the Resin Java EE 6 Web Profile Server
by Caucho Technologies (http://www.caucho.com/)

If you just want to use Arquillian together with Resin, please
head over to http://www.caucho.com/arquillian/

If you want to tweak the module, fix a bug or explore on how
to script Resin, then this source code is the right place to start.

The Arquillian Plugin for Resin comes in two fashions:
 1) Resin 4 as Embedded Server
 2) Resin 4 as Standalone Server (already running somewhere on your network)
    (not yet available)


To compile these Plugins, you have to setup your environment first.

 Prerequisite conditions:
 ------------------------
 You need the following tools to be able to compile the Arquillian Plugin
 for the Caucho Resin JavaEE Application Server
 a) Oracle Java >= 1.6.0_25 ( Java SE 6 Update 25 )
      As Maven, Arquillian and Resin are based on Java, you'll need this.
      Get the JDK (Java Development Kit) from
      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

 b) Apache Maven 3
      This is how the Plugins are built; get this from
      http://maven.apache.org/download.html
      and follow the setup instructions at the same page
      http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation

 c) Git
      Git is the Sourceode Management System (SCM) used to develop
      the Plugin. It is used by the Linux Kernel and a huge amount
      of open source projects.
      Get it at http://git-scm.com/download

 d) Github Account (Optional)
      If you plan to adjust the module and want your changes to be
      integrated, you'll need a Github Account. A free Account
      will do just fine, get it at
      https://github.com/signup/free

 Building the Plugin:
 --------------------

1. Create a workspace for Arquillian, e.g.
    /home/yourUsername/work/resin

   In Linux/MacOSX, open a shell and navigate to this directory by entering

   cd /home/yourUsername/work/resin

2. Checkout the Arquillian "Core" Module
   git clone git://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-core.git

3. Build the Arquillian BOM

   1) Change to the correct directory
        cd /home/yourUsername/work/resin/arquillian-core/bom/
   2) Switch to the correct tag
        git checkout 1.0.0.Beta1
   3) Install the "BOM"
        mvn clean compile install
      (Note: This might take a while as "maven is downloading the internet" ;) )

4. Checkout Caucho's Aruillian Repository

    You have to differentiate here if you would like to adjust the source code of the
    module (a) or just want to build it (b).

    a) If you want to adjust the code and get your changes upstream, do the following:
        Fork & Clone Caucho's Arquillian Repo
            - Go to https://github.com/caucho/arquillian-container-resin
            - Click the fork button on the top right of the page
            - Clone your own fork by doing the following
                cd /home/yourUsername/work/resin
                git clone git@github.com:/yourGithubUsername/arquillian-container-resin
                cd arquillian-container-resin
            - continue with step 5
    b) If you just want to build the module yourself
        Clone Caucho's Arquillian Repo
            cd /home/yourUsername/work/resin
            git clone git://github.com/caucho/arquillian-container-resin.git
            cd arquillian-container-resin

5. Build the module
    You should be in the directory
        /home/yourUsername/work/resin/arquillian-container-resin
    Now type to build and install the module
        mvn clean compile install
    As we're probably in the middle of a dvelopment cycle, your build might not
    complete successfully, then you'll have to reset your codebase to a solid
    state.
    To get a list of all tagged states, type
        git tag -l
    Choose a tag by typing
        git checkout <tagname>
        e.g. git checkout 1.0.0.Beta1
